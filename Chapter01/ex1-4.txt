What about this one? What if we change }} ti };} in the third line from the end?

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main(){
	{ const std::string s = "A string";
	  std::cout << s << std::endl; 

	{ const std::string s = "Another string";
	  std::cout << s << std::endl; }}

	return 0;
}

In this example, rather than two individual block it now shows a nested block. Both
blocks are still valid and outputs

	A string
	Another string
