Are the following definitions valid? Why or why not?

	const std::string hello = "Hello";
	const std::string message = hello + ", world" + "!";

Both definitions ar valid. At first thought it's easy to see that the definition of 
message has an illegal concatenation of two string literals. Because the string operatorconcat operator is left associative, the definition is the same as:

	cosnt std::string message = (hello + ", world") + "!";

Which is legal, as the result of hello + ", world" is a string object, not a literal
