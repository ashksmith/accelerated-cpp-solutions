Is the following program valid? If so, what does it do? If not, why not?

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main(){
	{ const std::string s = "A string";
	  std::cout << s << std::endl ; }

	{ const std::string s = "Another string";
	  std::cout << s << std::endl; }

	return 0;
}

Each instance of s is in a local block, all strings are defined properly.

The output of the program is 

	A string
	Another string
