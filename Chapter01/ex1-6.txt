Accelerated C++, Chapter 1, Exercise 1-6

What does the following program do if, when it asks for input, you have two names?
For example, Samuel Beckett.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main(void){
	std::cout << "What is your name? ";
	std::string name;
	std::cin >> name;
	std::cout << "Hello, " << name << std::endl << "And what is yours? ";
	std::cin >> name;
	std::cout << "Hello, " << name << "; nice to meet your too!" << std::endl;

	return 0;
}

Because cin >> will read up until the first white character it will stop after entering the first name. The program will work fine, but I believe the second name will be lost.

In reality what happens; I enter "Ashley Smith" into the first prompt, my entire name
is stored into the cin buffer. The assignment flushes my first name into the  name variable, leaving
behind "Smith" in the cin buffer. When it comes to taking input again, it finds Smith in the buffer and 
flushes into the name variable again. 

The ouput is 

What is your name?
Ashley Smith
Hello, Ashley
And what is yours?
Smith; nice to meet you too!
